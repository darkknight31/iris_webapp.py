# Iris-Classifier using ml
A website built using streamlit that classifies iris flowers , giving user 3 different option of machine learning model to use. This PROJECT compares the performance of logistic regression.Linear regression and support vector machines (SVM) on the Iris flower classification problem. The objective is to evaluate the accuracy, speed, and interpretability of these algorithms and provide insights into their strengths and limitations. The Iris dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. Logistic regression,Linear regression and SVM classifiers are implemented using scikit-learn and their performance is evaluated using cross-validation and grid search. Results show that both classifiers achieve high accuracy, with SVM slightly outperforming logistic regression. Logistic regression has advantages in terms of interpretability and ease of use, while SVM has advantages in terms of robustness and scalability. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application, and researchers should carefully consider the trade-offs between accuracy, interpretability, and scalability when choosing a classifier for the Iris dataset. This study provides useful insights into the strengths and limitations of these popular machine learning algorithms.
